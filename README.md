### There are three logic questions about javascript
*  Question 1: Clean the room function: given an input of [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], 
      make a function that organizes these into individual array that is ordered.  
      For example answer(ArrayFromAbove)  
     ### Solution: [\#cleanRoomFunction\#](https://github.com/joeban0608/ZeroToMaster_challenge-6/blob/main/S1_chanllenge_clean_room_function.js)
*  Question 2: Write a javascript function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. 
 The function should find two different numbers in the array that, when added together, 
 give the target number. For example: answer([1,2,3], 4)should return [1,3]
3. [\#TwoSum\#](https://github.com/joeban0608/ZeroToMaster_challenge-6/blob/main/S2_TwoSum.js)
4. [\#HexAndRgbCovert\#](https://github.com/joeban0608/ZeroToMaster_challenge-6/blob/main/S3-2_HexAndRgbCovert_cleaner_code.js)
